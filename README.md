# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

> The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. We have been asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, we need to repeat the school district analysis that and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Resources
* Data source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.10, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook

## Results

### District Summary Impact


* New District Summary including Thomas High School excluding 9th Grade reading and math scores

* Original District Summary excluding Thomas High School 9th Grade reading and math scores
 ![](https://github.com/timbialek/PyCity_School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/District_Summary_New.png)

 	
* The impact to the district summary is minimal and as you can see in the above two images can only be noticed when looking summary at the one-hundredth decimal place.   
	* Average Math score increasing by .01, 
	* Average Reading score staying the same
	* % Passing Math increasing by .02
	* % Passing Reading increased by .01
	* % Overall passing increasing by .03

* What is not seen in the district summary images is that the number of students used to perform the calculation went from 39,170 to 38,709 once the 9th grade students from Thomas high school are removed.  This decrease of 461 is only 1.18% of the total student population so it is not surprising that there was a negligible impact to scores.

### School Summary Impact
* When viewing the school summary, the only line that is impacted is for Thomas high school as no other schools had their data modified for the potential academic dishonesty.  Below is the before and after summaries for Thomas High School and the complete school summary for the new and original can be found by clicking on the following links: [New School Summary](https://github.com/timbialek/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_Summary_New.png) and [Original School Summary](https://github.com/timbialek/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/School_Summary_Original.png)
* As you can see in the below two images for Thomas High School there are some impacts to the scores as follows:
	* Average math score decreased by  -0.067412  (-0.08%)
	* Average Reading Score increased by +0.047152  (+0.06%)
	* Passing Math decreased by -0.086481  (-0.09%)
	* Passing Reading decreased by -0.29013  (0.30%)
	* Overall Passing decreased by -0.317688 (-0.35%)

### Ranking Impact
â€¢	Replacing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School had no impact on the school ranking as it places 2nd overall in the top 5 summary in both the new and original rankings as seen in the below images. The negative .3 decrease in the score was not quite enough to impact the ranking.

### Impact of Replacing the 9th Grade Scores

* **Impact of Replacing the Math and Reading scores by grade**

	* The impact to replacing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School is that they are no longer taken into account in the calculation of the scores and are reflected as null values in the data or nan when viewing the dataframe as in the below image.

----------


* **Impact on Scores by School Spending**

	* There is no impact on the spending per student because we did not adjust the number of students for the spending calculation.

Original Scores by School Spending

----------


* **Impact on Scores by School Size**
	* When looking at high level summaries of the data by School Size there is no impact from removing the Thomas High school 9th graders from summary.  Since we did not remove the 9th grade students from the population there is no impact to the calculation of the school size and there is not enough of a change in the avg scores or passing metrics to impact the results we are seeing.

---------


* **Impact on Scores by School Type**
	* Again, we can see here that there is no impact on the scores when summarized at this high of a level

## Summary:

After replacing the Thomas High School 9th graders scores with 'NaN' (not a number) in the student dataframe and recalculating the scores the notable changes can be seen when comparing the new and original scores for Thomas High School.

* The most significant change for the high school is the decrease in their Overall passing percentage from 90.95 to 90.63 which is a 0.35% decrease.  
* The second notable decrease was in the Reading passing percentage from 97.3 to 97.0 which is a 0.30% decrease in the score.  
* The math score and passing math percentage also went down but those changes are only seen when you go out the hundredth decimal point which implies that the change is not overly significant.  
* Lastly regarding Thomas High school their avg reading score did go up, which was the only number to increase, but even that was only by a small amount from 83.845 to 83.896 which is a 0.06% increase.  

None of these changes impact the high-level summaries by District, School Spending, School Size or School Type.  Prior to formatting those summaries, you can see some changes in the data when looking at the one-hundredth decimal place but once you format and round the differences are not noticeable.  With a 9th grade population of 461 students that is only 1.18% of the 39,170 total students in the analysis and there would have to have been some significant manipulation of the data to impact the high-level summaries.  In conclusion there does not appear to be enough information to definitively say there was academic dishonesty with regards to the 9th grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School.
